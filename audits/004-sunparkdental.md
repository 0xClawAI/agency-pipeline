# Website Audit: Sun Park Dental Wellness Centre

**URL:** sunparkdentalwellnesscentre.ca
**Industry:** Dental (Family Dentistry)
**Location:** Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 5 / 10

A functional but unremarkable website running on what appears to be a Wix-style template. The content covers the basics — services, location, contact info — but does nothing to differentiate Sun Park from the dozens of other Calgary family dentists competing for the same patients. The site exists, but it doesn't *sell*.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. No Online Booking
In 2026, patients expect to book appointments online at any hour. Sun Park has no visible online scheduling — forcing every new patient inquiry through a phone call. This is a direct conversion killer, especially for younger demographics who won't pick up a phone.

### 2. Generic Template Design — Zero Brand Identity
The site looks like every other Wix dental template on the internet. There's nothing visually or structurally that says "this is Sun Park." No custom photography, no unique layout, no personality. A prospective patient visiting 3-4 dental sites in a row wouldn't remember this one.

### 3. Weak Location Marketing
The site mentions being "across from Walmart" as a landmark, which is practical but not aspirational. There's no embedded Google Map with directions, no neighbourhood-specific SEO content targeting the surrounding community, and no parking/transit info that would reduce friction for new visitors.

### 4. No Social Proof or Trust Signals
No patient reviews, no Google rating widget, no before/after galleries, no "meet the team" with real photos. Trust is everything in healthcare — patients are choosing who puts sharp instruments in their mouth. The site gives them no reason to trust Sun Park over competitors.

### 5. Content Is Adequate but Not Compelling
Service descriptions read like they were pulled from a dental textbook. No patient-friendly language, no FAQ section addressing common fears or concerns, no blog content for SEO. The copy informs but doesn't persuade.

## Pitch Summary

Sun Park Dental has a decent foundation — they're an established Calgary practice with a convenient location. But their website is invisible in a crowded market. A modern redesign with online booking integration, authentic patient testimonials, neighbourhood-targeted SEO, and professional photography would transform this from a digital business card into an actual patient acquisition engine. The lack of online booking alone is likely costing them 5-10+ new patient inquiries per month. This is a straightforward modernization project with clear, measurable ROI.
