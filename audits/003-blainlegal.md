# Site Audit: Blain Legal

- **URL:** https://www.blainlegal.com/
- **Niche:** Legal (Personal Injury + Estate)
- **Location:** Calgary, AB
- **Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 5.5/10

## What They Do
Personal injury and estate administration law firm. 40+ years experience. Team of 3 lawyers. Offers free consultations.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Template Design — Not Premium Enough
For a firm with 40 years of experience, the site looks like a $500 Wix template. Doesn't match the caliber of the firm. Premium clients expect premium presentation.

### 2. Weak Social Proof
Has team pages (good) but no case results, no client testimonials, no review integration. The "free consultation" CTA is there but needs more trust-building around it.

### 3. Content Could Be Richer
Practice area pages exist but could go deeper. FAQ sections, blog content, and detailed case type pages would boost SEO significantly.

### 4. Speed & Performance
Loads reasonably but room for optimization. Faster = better rankings + lower bounce rate.

### 5. No Chat / Instant Contact
Modern legal sites have live chat or chatbot intake. This firm relies on traditional contact forms. Adding instant contact options would capture more leads after hours.

## Pitch Summary
"Your firm has 40 years of credibility but your website doesn't show it. A modern design with testimonials, richer content, and instant contact options would convert more of the visitors you're already getting. Here's a demo."

## Notes
Decent baseline — this is more of an upgrade sell than a rescue. Still a good candidate because the firm clearly values their online presence (they have a real site with real content).
