## Overall Score: 4 / 10

A relic of early-2010s web design that somehow survived into 2026. Dr. Pelletier has a genuinely compelling philosophy — conservative, no-upsell dentistry — that would resonate strongly with patients tired of being sold unnecessary procedures. But the website buries this gold under a dated, minimal design that screams "I don't care about my online presence." The disconnect between the quality of the practice and the quality of the site is stark.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Severely Outdated Design
The site looks like it was built 10-15 years ago and never updated. Minimal layout, no modern design elements, likely not mobile-responsive. In 2026, this signals to patients that the practice may be equally behind the times in their clinical approach — which is the opposite of the truth.

### 2. No Online Booking System
A solo practitioner with no online booking means every appointment requires a phone call during business hours. For a solo practice where the phone may go to voicemail during procedures, this is an even bigger problem — patients literally cannot reach the practice when they want to book.

### 3. Incredible USP Completely Wasted
"Conservative approach, no upselling" is a *killer* differentiator in dentistry. Patients actively search for dentists who won't push unnecessary crowns and veneers. This philosophy should be the centrepiece of the entire website — instead it's barely communicated. A proper site could build an entire brand around this trust-first approach.

### 4. No Trust Signals for 30+ Years of Experience
Three decades of practice with presumably thousands of loyal patients, and none of that social proof appears on the site. No reviews, no patient stories, no "about the doctor" section that brings the experience to life. The longevity alone is a trust signal — if it were visible.

### 5. Zero Content Strategy
No blog, no educational content, no FAQ. A conservative-approach dentist is perfectly positioned to create content like "Questions to ask before agreeing to a crown" or "When you DON'T need a filling." This content would attract exactly the right patients while building authority and SEO presence.

## Pitch Summary

Dr. Pelletier is a strong sell because the gap between practice quality and web presence is enormous. Here's a dentist with 30+ years of experience and a genuinely unique philosophy (no upselling, conservative care) — and their website does absolutely nothing with it. The pitch is simple: "Your practice philosophy is your biggest competitive advantage, and your website is hiding it." A modern, trust-focused site with online booking, patient testimonials, and content marketing around the conservative approach could significantly grow the patient base — especially among the growing demographic of patients who research extensively before choosing a provider. This is a case where a new website wouldn't just look better; it would fundamentally change the practice's growth trajectory.
