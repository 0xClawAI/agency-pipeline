**URL:** cranstondental.ca
**Industry:** Dental (Family Dentistry)
**Location:** SE Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 5.5 / 10

Better than average for a Calgary dental practice — Cranston Dental at least communicates some differentiators (evening appointments, free parking, nearly 20 years of experience). But the execution still falls into template territory with generic copy that doesn't capitalize on these strengths. The bones are there; the presentation isn't.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Template Design Undermines Credibility
Despite having legitimate differentiators, the Wix-style template makes Cranston Dental look like a brand-new practice, not one with nearly two decades of experience. The design doesn't match the maturity of the business. A practice with 20 years of trust deserves a site that reflects it.

### 2. Generic Copy That Wastes Good Selling Points
Evening appointments, ample parking, and two decades of experience are genuine competitive advantages — but they're buried in boilerplate text that reads like every other dental website. These should be front-and-centre with bold messaging, not listed like afterthoughts.

### 3. Likely Slow Page Load
Template-based sites with unoptimized images and bloated code are notorious for slow load times. In a market where 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load, speed is a patient acquisition issue. Every second of delay costs conversions.

### 4. No Patient Reviews or Social Proof Integration
Nearly 20 years means hundreds (maybe thousands) of satisfied patients. None of that trust equity is visible on the site. No Google Reviews widget, no testimonials, no case studies. This is a massive missed opportunity for a practice with this track record.

### 5. Limited SEO Strategy
The site likely targets "Calgary dentist" generically rather than owning "SE Calgary dentist" or "Cranston dentist" — hyperlocal terms that are easier to rank for and more relevant to their actual patient base. No blog, no neighbourhood content, no local SEO infrastructure.

## Pitch Summary

Cranston Dental is a mid-difficulty sell because the site isn't *terrible* — it's just mediocre, which in some ways is worse. They have real advantages (experience, convenience, location) that are being completely wasted by a cookie-cutter template. The pitch here is about unlocking existing value: a custom site that leads with their 20-year track record, showcases patient reviews prominently, targets SE Calgary / Cranston-specific search terms, and converts the visitors they're already getting. The ROI story writes itself — they're leaving money on the table with every visitor who bounces to a competitor with a more polished presence.
