# Website Audit: Hunter Horn Dental

**URL:** hunterhorndental.ca
**Industry:** Dental (Family Dentistry)
**Location:** Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 4.5 / 10

A Wix template dental site with a unique structural problem: two dentists (Dr. Law and Dr. Chan/Wong) sharing one clinic but presenting with two separate phone numbers. The result is a confusing user experience where patients aren't sure if they're booking with one practice or two. The generic template and muddled identity combine to undermine what could be a strength — having multiple practitioners under one roof.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Two Phone Numbers, One Clinic — Confusing UX
Having two separate phone numbers for what appears to be a single dental clinic is immediately confusing for patients. Which number do they call? Does it matter? Are these two separate practices sharing a space? The site doesn't clarify this, and confused visitors don't convert — they leave.

### 2. Wix Template With Zero Customization
Another stock dental template that does nothing to establish brand identity. No custom imagery, no unique design elements, no visual personality. Patients scrolling through Calgary dental options will forget this site the moment they navigate away.

### 3. Generic Content That Doesn't Leverage the Multi-Practitioner Advantage
Having two dentists in one clinic is actually a selling point — more availability, second opinions, different specialization areas. But the site presents this as an afterthought rather than a feature. The content reads like it was written for a single-dentist template and awkwardly stretched to cover two.

### 4. No Online Booking or Patient Portal
Standard missing feature for template dental sites. No way to book online, no patient intake forms, no digital convenience. Patients have to call — and given the two-number confusion, they may not know which number to dial.

### 5. No Reviews, Testimonials, or Team Bios
Patients choosing between two dentists at one clinic need more information, not less. There are no bios that help patients understand each doctor's style, no reviews indicating patient satisfaction, and no photos that humanize the team.

## Pitch Summary

Hunter Horn Dental's biggest problem is also its biggest opportunity: the two-dentist structure. Right now it creates confusion; with proper design, it becomes a competitive advantage ("Two experienced dentists, one convenient location — more availability, comprehensive care"). A custom website would unify the brand, give each practitioner a proper bio page, streamline contact into a single booking system, and turn the multi-doctor setup into a selling point. The pitch angle: "Your current site is confusing potential patients. Let us turn your unique practice structure into your strongest marketing asset."
