## Overall Score: 3.5 / 10

This site has problems at every level — from the domain name to the spelling. The practice itself has genuine strengths (30+ years experience, flat fee model, 24/7 availability) that are buried under a bare-bones, single-page site that looks like it was built in an afternoon. The typo ("lawer" instead of "lawyer") on a *lawyer's* website is the kind of detail that makes prospective clients physically cringe. Criminal defence clients are often desperate and searching at 2 AM — and this site does nothing to reassure them.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Typo on the Website — "Lawer" Instead of "Lawyer"
There is a visible typo on a criminal defence lawyer's website misspelling the word "lawyer." This alone could be the opening line of the pitch. It's embarrassing, it destroys credibility, and it signals that nobody is managing this site. If the lawyer doesn't catch a typo in their own job title, can they catch errors in legal filings?

### 2. Domain Name Is a Liability
"wojickcriminaldefencelawyer.ca" is absurdly long, impossible to spell from memory, impossible to communicate verbally, and impossible to type on mobile without errors. Nobody is typing this into a browser. If anyone ever needs to share this URL by word of mouth — in a jail visit, over the phone to a family member — it's hopeless.

### 3. Bare-Bones Single Page Design
The entire site appears to be one long page with minimal structure. No dedicated pages for practice areas, no case types breakdown, no FAQ for common criminal charges, no "what to do if you're arrested" content. For criminal defence — where clients are often panicked and information-seeking — this lack of content is a major failure.

### 4. Flat Fee Model Is a Massive USP — Completely Undermarketed
Flat fees in criminal defence is a genuine differentiator that addresses one of clients' biggest fears: unpredictable legal costs. This should be the headline of the entire site with a clear fee structure or at least ranges. Instead, it's mentioned in passing. This single selling point, properly marketed, could transform the practice.

### 5. 24/7 Availability Not Credibly Presented
Claiming 24/7 availability is powerful for criminal defence (arrests happen at all hours). But on a site this bare-bones, does a client trust that claim? There's no live chat, no after-hours booking form, no "call now" button that's prominent on mobile. The claim exists without the infrastructure to back it up.

## Pitch Summary

Wojick is one of the easiest sells in this batch. The typo alone is an icebreaker — "Did you know your website misspells 'lawyer'?" — that immediately establishes the need. Beyond that, this is a practice with three killer differentiators (30+ years experience, flat fees, 24/7 availability) and a website that communicates none of them effectively. The pitch: "You have a practice that sells itself — your website is actively working against you. Let us build something that turns your flat-fee model and 24/7 availability into a client magnet." A proper site with a short, memorable domain redirect, clear fee information, and a prominent emergency contact system would pay for itself within the first month. Criminal defence clients have high urgency and high lifetime value — every lost lead hurts.
