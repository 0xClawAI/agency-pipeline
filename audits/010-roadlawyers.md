**Industry:** Legal (DUI / Impaired Driving Defence)
**Location:** Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 4.5 / 10

Road Lawyers has a strong niche (DUI/impaired driving defence) and impressive claimed stats (90% win rate, 4000+ cases). The domain name is actually decent — short, memorable, relevant. But the site itself undermines these strengths with dated design, messy formatting, and broken internal link references that make the experience feel unpolished. For a firm claiming a 90% success rate, the website doesn't project the competence those numbers suggest.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Broken Internal Links
Visible broken link references throughout the site create a sloppy, abandoned feel. When a user clicks a link and nothing happens — or worse, gets an error — trust evaporates. For a law firm where clients are facing criminal charges and potential jail time, every broken element amplifies anxiety rather than building confidence.

### 2. Dated Design and Messy Formatting
The site feels like it was last properly designed 5-8 years ago. Inconsistent formatting, cluttered layout, and dated visual elements make it hard to navigate. DUI clients are stressed, often searching late at night after an incident — they need clean, clear, reassuring design. They're getting visual chaos.

### 3. Impressive Stats Not Properly Showcased
"90% win rate" and "4000+ cases" are extraordinary claims that should be the centrepiece of the entire site — with visual impact, supporting detail, and context. Instead, they're likely dropped into body text like an afterthought. These numbers, properly designed into hero sections with case breakdowns, would be devastatingly effective marketing.

### 4. No Clear Client Journey
A DUI client has an immediate, urgent problem. The site should guide them: "You were just charged → Here's what happens next → Here's how we help → Contact us now." Instead, the messy formatting forces clients to hunt for information. There's no clear call-to-action hierarchy, no urgency-driven conversion path.

### 5. Niche Authority Not Leveraged for SEO
DUI/impaired driving defence is a perfect niche for content marketing — there are dozens of specific charges, processes, and questions clients search for. "What happens after a DUI in Calgary," "Can I lose my licence for refusing a breathalyzer," etc. The site has no content strategy to capture this high-intent search traffic.

## Pitch Summary

Road Lawyers has arguably the best raw marketing material in this batch — a memorable domain, a tight niche, and eye-catching stats. The problem is purely execution. The pitch: "You have a 90% win rate and 4000+ cases — your website should be your best salesperson, not your weakest link. Let us build a site that turns those numbers into conversions." A modern redesign with a clear client journey (charged → learn → hire), prominent stats with visual impact, and an SEO content strategy targeting DUI-specific searches in Calgary would capitalize on what's already a strong market position. The ROI math is simple: DUI defence cases are $5K-15K+ each. Fix the site, capture more of the search traffic the niche already generates.
