**Location:** NW Calgary, AB

## Overall Score: 2 / 10

This is the easiest sell in the entire batch. Dolce Salon is a legitimate, established business — family-owned since 2007, 15 stylists, specializing in balayage — with a website that is essentially one paragraph. Not one page of content. One *paragraph*. For a visual industry where clients choose based on portfolio quality, having no photos of work is like a restaurant with no menu. The gap between the real business and the online presence is staggering.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. The Entire Website Is One Paragraph
This isn't an exaggeration. The site contains roughly one paragraph of text. For a business with 15 stylists, 18+ years of history, and a balayage specialty, this is indefensible. There's virtually no information for a prospective client to evaluate. The site is functionally useless.

### 2. Zero Portfolio / No Photos of Work
Hair salons live and die by visual proof. Clients want to see balayage transformations, colour corrections, styling work. Instagram exists specifically for this. Dolce's website has *no photos of their work*. In a visual industry, this is the equivalent of a surgeon with no credentials — "trust us, we're good" without any evidence.

### 3. No Services List or Pricing
A client cannot determine what services Dolce offers or what they cost. No service menu, no pricing ranges, no package descriptions. A prospective client literally cannot make a buying decision from this website. They have to call and ask "what do you even do?" — and most won't bother.

### 4. No Online Booking System
15 stylists means complex scheduling. Without online booking, every appointment is a phone call or walk-in. Modern salon clients — especially the demographic that seeks out balayage — expect to browse stylists, see their work, and book online at midnight. Dolce offers none of this.

### 5. 18 Years of Business, Zero Online Reputation Visible
Family-owned since 2007 with 15 stylists suggests a thriving, well-loved business. Where are the reviews? Where are the loyal client testimonials? Where's the "our story" page that makes the family ownership feel warm and authentic? None of this exists on the site. The business's best qualities are completely invisible online.

## Pitch Summary

Dolce Salon is the strongest pitch opportunity in this batch — possibly the strongest we've seen. The business is real, established, and successful (you don't keep 15 stylists employed for 18 years without doing great work). But the website is effectively non-existent. The pitch writes itself: "You have 15 talented stylists and 18 years of happy clients. Your website has one paragraph and zero photos. Every day, potential clients are searching 'balayage Calgary' and finding your competitors instead of you." A modern salon website with stylist profiles, portfolio galleries, online booking (via Fresha, Vagaro, or similar), service menus with pricing, and Google Reviews integration wouldn't just improve their online presence — it would create one for the first time. For a salon this size, the ROI is immediate and obvious: even 2-3 additional bookings per week at $150-300 average ticket would pay for the site within the first month.
