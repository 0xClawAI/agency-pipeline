# Website Audit: SHD Lawyers (Stephens Holman Devraj)

**URL:** shdlawyers.ca
**Industry:** Legal (Personal Injury)
**Location:** Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 5 / 10

SHD Lawyers has some things going for it — real client testimonials, 30+ years of combined experience, and a focused personal injury practice. But the execution is sabotaged by a Wix template with visible broken elements (comp- references leaking into navigation), which is particularly damaging for a law firm where credibility and attention to detail are everything. A personal injury client trusting you with a life-changing case needs to see competence at every touchpoint — including your website.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Broken Navigation Elements Visible to Users
"Comp-" references showing in the navigation are Wix component IDs leaking through — a technical error that screams unprofessionalism. For a law firm, this is devastating. If opposing counsel ever pulled up this site in court preparation, it would undermine the firm's image. Clients noticing these errors may question the firm's attention to detail — the exact quality they need in their lawyer.

### 2. Wix Template Doesn't Match the Firm's Calibre
30+ years of personal injury experience deserves better than a cookie-cutter template. Personal injury is a high-stakes, high-trust practice area. The website needs to project authority, competence, and success. A Wix template projects "we spent an afternoon on this."

### 3. Testimonials Exist But Are Poorly Showcased
Having client testimonials is a genuine advantage — most law firms don't. But they're likely buried or poorly formatted within the template. These should be prominently featured with proper design treatment: large quotes, client initials/details, case outcome context. This is their best marketing asset and it's being wasted.

### 4. No Case Results or Settlement Amounts
Personal injury clients want to know: "How much have you won for people like me?" The site appears to lack any case results page or settlement range information. This is standard for competitive PI firms and a major gap.

### 5. Weak SEO for High-Value Keywords
Personal injury keywords in Calgary are extremely competitive and extremely valuable (cost-per-click for "Calgary personal injury lawyer" is likely $50-100+). Without proper SEO infrastructure — dedicated practice area pages, blog content, schema markup, local SEO — SHD is invisible for the searches that matter most to their revenue.

## Pitch Summary

SHD Lawyers is a compelling pitch because the stakes are high and visible. Broken elements on a personal injury firm's website aren't just ugly — they're potentially costing the firm six-figure cases. Clients doing due diligence (which PI clients absolutely do) will see the broken nav, the template design, and move on to a competitor who looks more established. The pitch: "You have 30+ years of experience and real client testimonials — your website is the only thing making you look like a startup. Let us build a site that matches your track record." Given the high lifetime value of PI clients ($5K-50K+ per case), even one additional client per month makes the ROI obvious.
