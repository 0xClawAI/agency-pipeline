# Website Audit: Amanoh Law Firm

**URL:** amanohlawfirm.com
**Industry:** Legal (General Practice)
**Location:** Calgary, AB
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 4 / 10

Amanoh Law Firm's website feels like it was launched before it was finished. The building blocks are there — over a decade of experience, free consultations, after-hours appointments — but the content is so thin it raises more questions than it answers. A prospective client visiting this site can't determine what the firm actually specializes in, what their track record looks like, or why they should choose Amanoh over any other Calgary lawyer. The site exists, but barely.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Critically Thin Content
The site provides almost no meaningful information about the firm's practice areas. Clients looking for a lawyer need specifics: What types of cases do you handle? What's your approach? What outcomes have you achieved? Amanoh's site answers none of these questions. A potential client would leave more confused than when they arrived.

### 2. Practice Areas Listed Without Substance
If practice areas are mentioned, they appear to be listed as names without supporting content — no descriptions, no "what to expect," no relevant legal information. Each practice area should be a full page with educational content, process explanations, and clear CTAs. Instead, they're bullet points leading nowhere.

### 3. Free Consultations and After-Hours — Buried Advantages
Free consultations and after-hours availability are significant differentiators, especially for working professionals who can't take time off for legal appointments. These should be prominent, repeated, and designed into the site's conversion architecture. Currently they're mentioned but not marketed.

### 4. No Social Proof Whatsoever
A decade of experience should produce at least some testimonials, case references, or professional accolades. The site has none. For a general practice lawyer competing against firms with robust online reputations, this absence is a competitive death sentence.

### 5. Feels Incomplete — Damages Credibility
The overall impression is of a site that was started but never finished. For a law firm, this perception is particularly harmful. Clients may wonder: "If they can't complete their own website, will they complete my legal work?" Fair or not, the incomplete feel creates subconscious doubt.

## Pitch Summary

Amanoh Law is a strong pitch candidate because the need is obvious and the fix is clear. The site feels unfinished — and for a law firm, "unfinished" is synonymous with "untrustworthy." The pitch: "Your website is your first impression, and right now it's telling clients you're not ready for their case. Let us build a complete, professional site that showcases your decade of experience and makes your free consultation offer impossible to ignore." The after-hours availability angle alone could be a powerful marketing differentiator with proper execution. General practice law is competitive in Calgary — without a professional web presence, Amanoh is invisible to the clients who need them most.
