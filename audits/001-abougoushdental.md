# Site Audit: Abougoush Family Dental Care

- **URL:** https://www.abougoushdental.com/
- **Niche:** Dental
- **Location:** Calgary, AB
- **Audit Date:** 2026-02-16

## Overall Score: 5/10

## What They Do
Family dental clinic offering preventative, restorative, and cosmetic dentistry. Promotes free teeth whitening for new patients and complimentary Invisalign consultations.

## Pain Points (Pitch Angles)

### 1. Generic Copy — No Differentiator
The homepage reads like every other dental site. "Committed to your oral health" and "no two smiles are alike" are filler. Nothing tells a potential patient why THIS dentist vs the one down the street.

### 2. No Visible Online Booking
In 2026, patients expect to book online instantly. No booking widget visible on the homepage — that's lost conversions every day.

### 3. SEO-Thin Service Pages
Service pages exist but lack depth. Thin content = poor Google rankings. Competitors with richer content will outrank them for "Calgary dentist" searches.

### 4. Page Speed
Site loads but feels sluggish. Modern patients bounce after 3 seconds. Speed optimization would improve both UX and SEO.

### 5. Mobile Experience
Needs verification but template-based sites often have mediocre mobile layouts. Over 60% of dental searches are mobile.

## Pitch Summary
"Your site has decent bones but it's invisible to Google, has no online booking, and reads like every other dental site in Calgary. We can fix all three and get you more patients — here's a demo of what yours could look like."
